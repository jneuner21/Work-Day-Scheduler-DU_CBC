# Work-Day-Scheduler-DU_CBC

## Description

For this project we were tasked with fixing existing code. and creating a living day scheduler that changed with the hours of the day to show if an event we wanted to note was coming up, happening now, or happened earlier.

- Motivation behind this project was learning the workings of jquery and how to better utalize it with JavaScript
- I built this project because I needed to push myself and better understand this coding language
- The Problems solved in this assignment were linking multiple source script tags into my html and make them work as well as being able to save a pay planner that interacted with the day and all the buttons in it.
- I learned that there is still a lot to learn about built in Javascript functions and jquery is a great short hand tool to understand them and have a better understanding of behavioral coding language
